'''
You can create your own functions by using the def statement.

Here’s an example of a function named my_func. It takes no arguments, and prints "spam" three times.
'''

def my_func():
  print("spam")
  print("spam")
  print("spam")

# Just like with if statements, the code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.

# So once you’ve defined a function, you can call it multiple times in your code.

def hello():
  print("Hello world!")

hello()
hello()
hello()

'''
BE CAREFUL !
The function needs to be defined before it can be called. 
Calling a function before its definition will cause an error.
