'''
A function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.
'''

# A function has a name and can have arguments.

print('Hello')

# Here, print is the function name and "Hello" is the argument.

'''
Functions can have multiple arguments.

For example, range(2, 20) has two arguments, 2 and 20.
