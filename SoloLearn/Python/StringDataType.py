'''
We use quotation marks to tell Python that we are working with a piece of text data or string. Choosing double " or single ' quotation marks doesn't affect how the string behaves in any way.
'''

print("I am a String")

'''
In Python, some arithmetic operators can also be applied to strings.

We can join two strings together, also known as concatenation
'''

print("Hello " + 'World')

'''
Anything in quotes is a string, even numbers. Numbers in quotes will be treated as a piece of text data and you wonâ€™t be able to perform arithmetic operations with them.
'''

print("26" + "9")

'''
Note : in the code above, 28 and 6 are strings, not numbers. The computer understood that we want these values to behave as pieces of text.

Summary :
1. A string is the data type for text.
2. Strings require either single or double quotation marks to be understood by computers.
3. You can join two or more strings together using concatenation (+).
