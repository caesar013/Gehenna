<!-- HTML documents are made up of HTML elements.
An HTML element is written using a start tag and an end tag, and with the content in between. -->

<!-- HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements. In the example below, 
    the body element includes the <p> tags, the <br /> tag and the content, "This is a paragraph" -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            first page
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph. <br></p>
    </body>
</html>
