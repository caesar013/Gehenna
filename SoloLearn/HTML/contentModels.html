<!-- 
In HTML, elements typically belonged in either the block level or inline content model. HTML5 introduces seven main content models.

- Metadata
- Embedded
- Interactive
- Heading
- Phrasing
- Flow
- Sectioning 
-->

<!-- The HTML5 content models are designed to make the markup structure more meaningful for both the browser and the web designer. -->
