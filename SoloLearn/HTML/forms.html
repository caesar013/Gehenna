<!-- HTML forms are used to collect information from the user.
Forms are defined using the <form> element, with its opening and closing tags -->

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Form Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Use the action attribute to point to a webpage that will load after the user submits the form. -->
        <!-- Warning ! Usually the form is submitted to a web page on a web server. -->
        <!-- The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when forms are submitted -->
        <form action="" > 

            <!-- 
                To take in user input, you need the corresponding form elements, such as text fields. 
                The <input> element has many variations, depending on the type attribute. 
                It can be a text, password, radio, URL, submit, etc. 
            -->
            
            <input type="text" name="username"><br>
            <input type="password" name="password"> <br>
            <!-- The name attribute specifies a name for a form. -->

            <!-- If we change the input type to radio, it allows the user select only one of a number of choices -->

            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male <br>
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female <br>

            <!-- The type "checkbox" allows the user to select more than one option: -->

            <input type="checkbox" name="genderCB" value="1"> Male <br>
            <input type="checkbox" name="genderCB" value="2"> Female <br>

            <!-- The submit button submits a form to its action attribute -->

            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page address. -->
<!-- 
Use POST if the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (passwords).
POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.
