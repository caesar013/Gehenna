<!-- The <img> tag is used to insert an image. It contains only attributes, and does not have a closing tag.

The image's URL (address) can be defined using the src attribute -->

        <!-- The alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image. -->
        <!-- You need to put in the image location for the src attribute that is between the quotation marks -->
        <!-- To define the image size, use the width and height attributes. -->
        <!-- but actually, we can just set one of them and the other would get adjusted automatically -->
        <img src="tree.jpg" alt="Oak tree" height="50px" width="50%" border="1px">
        <!-- By default, an image has no borders. Use the border attribute within the image tag to create a border around the image. -->
